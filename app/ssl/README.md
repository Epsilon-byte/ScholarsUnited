# SSL Certificates for HTTPS

This directory contains SSL certificates for enabling HTTPS on the Scholars United application.

## For Development

The development certificates are self-signed and should only be used in development environments.

## For Production

In production, you should replace these with proper SSL certificates from a trusted certificate authority like Let's Encrypt.
